Description:
============
This example shows how you can create new gestures (ofxGesture) and add them 
to the gesture recognizer (ofxOneDollar). You can use this example to create
a textfile with stored gestures which you then can match in your own 
application.

Important:
==========
Note that when you load textures which you previously saved, the lines
are rotated to the most optimal position so when matching they will be
rotated.
